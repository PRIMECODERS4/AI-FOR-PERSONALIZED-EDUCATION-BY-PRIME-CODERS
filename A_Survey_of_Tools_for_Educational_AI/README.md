These digital agents, or "bots," are engineered to perform a wide array of functions, from generating quizzes to providing constructive feedback on student submissions. The concept of "Bot Gardens" represents a curated ensemble of these task-oriented bots, which are either explicitly designed for educational purposes or can be tailored to fit such contexts. This framework empowers educators to seamlessly integrate a variety of bots into bespoke educational ecosystems, effectively creating custom-tailored mentorship experiences for learners. For example, a versatile quiz bot can be reconfigured into a specialized tutor focused on a particular discipline, such as mathematics or visual arts, under the guidance of educational professionals.

Furthermore, the integration of AI Task Routing mechanisms, commonly referred to as "router bots" or "orchestration layers," enhances the functionality of bot gardens by managing the distribution of tasks among the available bots. These router bots assess the nature of each inquiry or task, leveraging context or content cues to assign it to the most appropriate task-specific bot. This process includes soliciting additional information from users whenever the initial request lacks clarity, ensuring that each student's question is addressed by the most capable digital agent. This dynamic interplay between various types of bots—including task bots, orchestration bots, and others—establishes a robust infrastructure for adaptive and responsive educational tools.
