# The AI for Education Project (AI4ED) Volunteer Projects

Many volunteer projects will be added to this page. The first project involves the evaluation of tools for Educational AI. For each category, we explore evaluation criteria such as performance metrics, ease of use, scalability, adaptability to educational content, ethical considerations, cost-effectiveness, support and community engagement, and innovation potential. These criteria provide a structured framework to assess the capabilities, user experience, and overall impact of AI tools in education.

## Project One - The Evaluation of Software and Tools for Educational AI

The evaluation criteria are here [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI)

### Steps:
- Add yourself as a collaborator and star this repo [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/) 
- Find software, data, model and tools related to one of the categories below. 
- Update these two lists with the software and tools [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/blob/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI/Educational_Software_Data.md](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/blob/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI/Educational_Software_Data.md) and [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/blob/main/Awesome_Educational_AI/README.md](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/blob/main/Awesome_Educational_AI/README.md)
- Pick one of the categories below as a topic to study.
- Look at the criteria to evaluate your topic according to these criteria [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/A_Survey_of_Tools_for_Educational_AI)
- Create tables with your results.
- Draft a survey paper to be published on [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/) Use these papers as guides to write your paper. [https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/Papers](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/AI4ED/tree/main/Papers)
- Follow the Yale Guidance on Authorship in Scholarly or Scientific Publications [https://provost.yale.edu/policies/academic-integrity/guidance-authorship-scholarly-or-scientific-publications](https://provost.yale.edu/policies/academic-integrity/guidance-authorship-scholarly-or-scientific-publications) with Nik Bear Brown as the last author.
- Reach out to Siddhartha Bariker on Slack with questions. He is coordinating this effort in Spring 2024.

- The AI for Education Project (AI4ED)

## The AI for Education Project (AI4ED)

The AI for Education Project (AI4ED) at Northeastern University is pioneering the fusion of artificial intelligence with educational practices to revolutionize how teaching and learning are approached. This initiative is breaking new ground by developing open-source tools like Project SmartyBots, which leverages Large Language Models for educational purposes, and by promoting innovative methods such as prompt engineering and the creation of task-specific bots for personalized learning experiences. It also explores the use of vector databases for enhancing the performance of AI models and supports the creation of no-code chatbots, thus democratizing AI access for educators. Furthermore, the project emphasizes the importance of fine-tuning custom LLMs for educational settings and showcases practical applications of AI in teaching through examples like virtual office hours assistants, academic writing support, and lecture enhancement. By integrating AI into various aspects of education, from curriculum development to the creation of interactive learning tools, AI4ED aims to make education more accessible, efficient, and tailored to individual needs. The project's commitment to collaborative development and its focus on ethical AI use highlight its role in shaping a future where education and AI evolve together to offer transformative learning experiences.
